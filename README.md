# Gregification Document

Gregification is a process where an individual devotes time to Gregic modpacks such as GTNH, Supersymmetry, TerraFirmaGreg New Horizons, TerraFirmaRescue, Nomifactory CEu Hard Mode, and more. 

The Process of Gregification is divided into stages:
Gregification Alpha
Gregification Beta
Gregification Delta
Gregification Epsilon
Gregification Gamma
Gregification Zeta
Gregification Sigma
Gregification Omega

Each Gregification Stage corresponds to increasing levels of Greg on the personality, the moral code, and the values and actions of such individual.

The Gregic Code of Conduct are a series of directives that every gregger must follow. These are :
- Praise Greg
- Devote time to Greg
- Spread the Gregification
- Worship GregoriusT
- Play Gregic Modpacks Everyday
- Studying Chemistry, Physics and any branch of Science in real life as a major.
- Admire Gregic Complexity

Ungregic Actions atleast include:
- Spreading Anti-Greg Propoganda
- Mispelling the name of GregoriusT on purpose
- Admiring Mekanism instead of GregTech
- Being part of the acidic sons of mekanism
- Spreading anti-science propoganda.
- Impersonating the creator of GregTech

# Notice

This is a fork of supersymmetry that aims to maximize torture of your balls.

This project is sponsored by the shadow government

Chemistry Book Torture will not have anime. If you want anime go to Cock and Ball Touhouture instead.

If you want to complain then explode you acidic son of mekanism
